goganesh
========

Go implementation of something like [yeganesh](http://dmwit.com/yeganesh/), but much simpler right now.
The mechanism is plainly naive: it just increments counters.

Also, it's not a wrapper around dmenu, but look at the bash script, should help to integrate them together.


Why
---
I don't have any need of the whole Haskell ecosystem and I wanted to do something useful (read: useful for me, maybe) in Go.


TODO
----
- [ ] Use geometric mean and exponential decay
